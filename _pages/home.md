Lecturer and researcher of computer science at [INSA de Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr), France. I'm a research member of the [CITI](http://www.citi-lab.fr) laboratory at the [Dynamid](http://dynamid.citi-lab.fr) team.  
My research interests include software and model verification, middlewares for pervasive computing, software architecture, and distributed systems, with a focus on the Internet of Things (IoT).  
I have a PhD in computer science from the [Université de Franche-Comté](http://univ-fcomte.fr). My thesis, about the verification of SysML specifications, can be downloaded [here](/assets/publis/thesis.pdf).
