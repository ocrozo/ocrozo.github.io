Associate professor of computer sciences and networking at [CPE Lyon](http://www.cpe.fr), France. 
I'm a research member of the [CITI](http://www.citi-lab.fr) laboratory at [INSA Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr) and my research team is [Dynamid](http://dynamid.citi-lab.fr).  
My research interests include software and model verification, middlewares for pervasive computing, software architecture, and distributed systems, with a focus on the Internet of Things (IoT).  
I have a PhD in computer science from the [Université de Franche-Comté](http://univ-fcomte.fr). My [thesis]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/publis/thesis.pdf), developped at [Femto-ST](http://www.femto-st.fr) laboratory in Besançon, France, was about the verification of SysML specifications of component-based systems.
